# Credit Score Classification

## Overview
Credit score classification is an essential task in financial risk assessment, helping institutions evaluate an individual's creditworthiness. This project builds a classification model using machine learning techniques to categorise credit scores into "Poor," "Standard," and "Good" based on multiple financial and behavioral indicators. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains critical financial attributes, such as:
- **Age, Occupation, and Annual Income**
- **Number of Bank Accounts and Credit Cards**
- **Debt Utilization and Outstanding Debt**
- **Loan History, Credit Mix, and Payment Behavior**
- **Monthly Balance and Investment Details**

The data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and categorical features such as "Credit Mix" are transformed into numerical values for machine learning compatibility.

## Key Features

üìå **Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values and categorical features
- Transformed the "Credit Mix" categorical column into numerical values
- Normalized numerical data to improve model performance

üìä **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Identified correlations between financial attributes
- Analyzed distributions and outliers using box plots and histograms
- Assessed feature importance using statistical methods

ü§ñ **Machine Learning Model Implementation**
- Split data into training and test sets
- Implemented classification model- Randon Forest
- Fine-tuned model for better accuracy


üîç **Prediction & Visualization**
- Predicted credit scores based on financial inputs
- Visualised model performance using confusion matrices and interactive graphs
- Generated insights into which factors influence credit scores the most

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in credit score classification. By leveraging financial data and advanced modeling techniques, the model provides a structured approach to evaluating creditworthiness. However, real-world credit scoring involves additional external factors, making continuous model improvements essential.
